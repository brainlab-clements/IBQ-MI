# IBQ-MI
Code for the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Measurement Invariance Project. 
There are three R script files. To run analysis, run them in order (01, 02, 03) and do not clear environment between runs.
In the code, there are modifications needed (e.g. file paths, initials). Please change those before running code. This should be a 1 time modification.
